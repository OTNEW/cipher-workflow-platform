CIPHER is a data processing pipeline suite for next generation sequencing data including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, DNase-seq, MNase-seq, and GRO-seq. By taking advantage of the Nextflow language, and Docker containers, CIPHER is an extremely easy to use, and reproducible pre-processing workflow toolkit.

CIPHER also includes a simple random forest-based ML model for the de-novo identification of enhancer elements based on DNase, H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me3 bedGraph files.
